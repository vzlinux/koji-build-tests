This project is a Koji builder plugin to automatically run tests on the built
packages before tagging them.

Installation
------------

To install the plugin do the following:
1. Create /usr/lib/koji-builder-plugins directory.
2. Copy *.py from the current directory there.
3. Copy *conf file from the current directory to /etc/kojid/ folder
4. Open the file /etc/kojid/kojid.conf and uncomment or add the following
   parameters, and set their values like that:
	PluginPath = /usr/lib/koji-builder-plugins
	Plugins = run_tests
5. Restart Koji builder service:
	# systemctl restart kojid.service
6. Tests can be enabled/disabled by switching 'tests_enabled' flag in
   /etc/kojid/run_tests.conf without restarting kojid

Using
-----

After you install the plugin, the tagBuild task will run the new runTests
subtask. If the latter fails, tagging will also fail, and the build will not be
included into the tag.

If build with failed tests must be tagged anyway, one can use the forced mode:
$ koji tag-build --force tag_name build_name
In this case the tests will still run but failure will not prevent the build
from being tagged in the end.

List of tests
-------------

At the moment only the installation test is performed: the set of RPM files for
each architecture is installed into a clean root directory using the build tag
repository as the only source of packages. Thus, the dependencies of the built
packages are validated.
